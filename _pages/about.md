I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Economic Research Unit of the [IFC-World Bank Group](https://www.ifc.org/en/home). I obtained my PhD in Economics from [Sciences Po Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/) in June 2025, under the supervision of [Benjamin Marx](https://sites.google.com/view/bmarx/home) and [Pierre-Philippe Combes](https://sites.google.com/view/pierrephilippecombes/).

My research interests are in development, urban and environmental economics. At a broad level, I am interested in the interactions of rapid urbanization with governance and state capacity in lower and middle income countries.

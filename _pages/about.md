Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Economics at Sciences Po Paris working under the supervision of [Benjamin Marx](https://sites.google.com/view/bmarx/home) and [Pierre-Philippe Combes](https://sites.google.com/view/pierrephilippecombes/). My research focuses on questions in urban, development and environmental economics - mainly in South(ern) Africa.

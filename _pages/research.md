<ins>Human Costs of Competition in Informal Markets: Evidence from South Africa</ins>

**Abstract:** High rates of violent crime are a pervasive issue in many lower and middle income countries. A growing literature in economics has focused on understanding the drivers of violence through studying the governance of and competition between criminal organisations operating in markets for illegal goods. However, little work has been done on the conditions under which violence can emerge as an externality to competition in legal, but informal industries in developing countries. This paper studies the interactions of economic competition and violence in the context of the semi-formal minibus taxi industry in South Africa. As in many other developing countries, this industry plays a crucial role in light of the inadequacy of the public transport networks in rapidly growing cities. Low barriers to entry and a lack of regulatory capacity means that the industry is highly competitive. Using administrative data from the operating license information system, novel collected price data from taxi ranks and a unique dataset of violent crimes associated with the taxi industry, this paper asks whether there is an underlying economic structure that explains outbreaks of violence.  

<ins>The Political Economy of Migration Restrictions under Apartheid</ins>, with [Tomás Domínguez-Iino](https://www.tomasdomingueziino.com/) 

**Abstract:** Non-democratic states often promote the development of strategic industries while simultaneously restricting internal migration. One objective of such restrictions is to provide key sectors of the economy with cheap labour. In this paper we study the case of Apartheid South Africa, where strict internal migration restrictions were imposed on the (majority) black population from 1923 until 1986. In part, this was done to divert cheap labour to the mining and agricultural sectors, which were important sources of tax revenue and political capital respectively. Using data from Apartheid and post-Apartheid South African censuses, we document dramatic changes in internal geographic mobility patterns when restrictions are in place and after they are removed. We then build and estimate a migration choice model combined with a political economy module where the government can choose to impose migration restrictions to divert cheap labour to strategic industries.

<ins>Individual agglomeration gains and sorting in South Africa</ins>

**Abstract:** How do agglomeration economies in lower and middle income countries differ from those in high income countries? This paper uses a large administrative panel data set on the universe of registered tax payers to derive precise estimates of the magnitude of agglomeration gains in South Africa. Following standard methods in the empirical urban economics literature closely, I derive estimates for the effect of urban density on wages controlling for individual and area fixed effects. 

<ins>Traditional leaders and local government</ins>, with [Dieter Von Fintel](https://www.ekon.sun.ac.za/dvf)

**Abstract:** In many African countries dual systems of institutions exist. Modern, democratic governments exist alongside systems of traditional leadership, communal land tenure and customary courts. In South Africa, roughly a third of the population -18 million people- reside in areas under some form of traditional authority. This paper evaluates the impact of a reform allowing for the participation of traditional leaders on municipal councils on service delivery, spending outcomes and public perceptions. We create a new database by searching through and extracting detailed information from South African government gazettes and combine this with yearly panel data on municipal finances, service delivery and audit outcomes. Preliminary results suggest the participation of traditional leaders leads to limited changes in municipal service delivery and spending priorities, but coincides with an increase in irregular expenditure and a significant increase in protests in municipalities affected by the reform.
